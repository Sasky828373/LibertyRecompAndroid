// sub_82A46D70(device r3, out r4) writes {0, submitted frame, submitted -
// completed} for the device. Its only caller, sub_828BF420, polls it in a
// loop without sleeping while two frames are pending, i.e. while the title
// waits for the renderer to submit a frame: a busy-wait that held a big core
// at ~7% of the main game thread's samples. Sleep briefly when the title is
// about to spin; the game's own loop still decides when to stop waiting.
//
// The same two-frame limit caps throughput: one frame passes the command
// worker, the recorder and the GPU in sequence (~75 ms at the bridge), so two
// in flight give ~38 ms per frame while every stage has slack. Reporting
// fewer pending frames lets the title run that many frames further ahead; the
// renderer's own queue still bounds the total.
