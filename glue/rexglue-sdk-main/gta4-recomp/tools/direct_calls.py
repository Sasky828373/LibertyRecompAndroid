"""Direct calls between recompiled functions (after nfsmw-nx's llamadas_directas.py).

DEFINE_REX_FUNC makes every sub_X a weak alias of __imp__sub_X so that a hook
(REX_HOOK_RAW) can replace it at link time. The generated code always calls
sub_X, and no compiler inlines through a weak alias, not even with LTO. This
rewrites `sub_X(ctx, base)` to `__imp__sub_X(ctx, base)` for every function
without a hook. The function table (indirect calls) keeps sub_X, so indirect
calls still reach hooks.

A function is hooked when its sub_X in the linked libmain.so is a strong
symbol, i.e. its address differs from __imp__sub_X. That list is kept in
direct_calls_hooked.txt next to this script.

  direct_calls.py hooks <nm-output>   refresh the hooked list from `llvm-nm --defined-only libmain.so`
  direct_calls.py apply               rewrite the generated sources (idempotent)
  direct_calls.py undo                restore sub_X calls
  direct_calls.py check <nm-output>   fail if a hooked function is ever called directly

Run `apply` again after every code generation: it silently loses the rewrite.
